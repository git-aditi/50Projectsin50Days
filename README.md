# 50Projectsin50Days

PREFACE: This code is not ALL mine. I have been inspired by Brad Traversy and learned from his course on Udemy and learnt what I did in this repository. I have learned to tweak some code to make it appear according to my preference but the templates are all his. Here is a link to the original creator's 50 Days repository: https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days/tree/master
And the link to his course: https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/

While inspired and regardless of the same code, I have written every line myself. To ensure I learn as I go, I have NOT copy pasted any code - other than any image or font URLs.

Thank you, and I hope to inspire you as Brad Traversy has inspired me.

Happy coding!
